# Clueful Index - clueful.fyi

Many organizations have limited awareness about modern software and technology, even though software is essential for them. Use the Clueful Index to separate the clueless organizations from the clueful.

The 'clueful indicators' relate to the public profile presented by the organization:

* engineering blog
* social media posts
* product documentation
* other public articles and writing
* public talks by staff
* internal tech conferences
* details of outages and incidents
* contributions to open source software
* use of open source software
* use of good practices

The presence and quality of these public resources can often (although not always) give a good indication of the 'cluefulness' of the organization.

## Use Cases

Use the Clueful Index to answer questions such as:

* Should I apply for a job at this organization? ðŸ’¼
* Should I invest my money with this organization? ðŸ’µ (banks, investment companies, etc.)
* Should I use this organization as a supplier? ðŸš›

Why? If an organization has a poor grasp of technology and practices, do you really want to work there? If a bank has a poor grasp of technology and practices, do you really want to invest your money there? If an organization has a poor grasp of technology and practices, do you really want to rely on their services?

Modern software systems are complicated (even complex) and organizations that have little clue about the technology and practices needed risk data loss, outages, security breaches, and more.

# The clueful indicators

# Results

Add up the scores! ðŸ“‹

- 20 or above: wow! This organization seems very clueful. ðŸŽ‰
- 15 to 19: not bad. Probably a good choice.
- 10 to 14: reasonable. Investigate further?
- 5 to 9: maybe best avoided.
- 0 to 4: proceed with caution.
- less than 0: stay clear unless you have other indicators. â˜£

# Discussion

Take the Clueful Index with a pinch of salt ðŸ§‚ (don't take it too seriously). Some organizations may exhibit all the Clueful Indicators but still be terrible at technology. Other organizations may be truly excellent at technology but have few public Clueful Indicators.
